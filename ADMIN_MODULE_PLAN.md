## Quick Implementation (What I can do now):

### 1. Professional Footer ✅ DONE
- Added your email: srivathsa.m2024aids@sece.ac.in
- Professional 4-column layout
- Social media links
- Quick links section

### 2. I can create basic structure for Admin module

Would you like me to:
A) Create the complete admin module structure (will take multiple iterations)
B) Focus on homepage redesign first
C) Implement admin dashboard with graphs first

Please choose, and I'll proceed step by step.

## Note on Images:
For realistic images, you'll need to either:
1. Use free stock photos (I can add URLs)
2. Use AI-generated images
3. Use SVG illustrations (I can create these)

I cannot generate or host actual images, but I can integrate image URLs into the design.
